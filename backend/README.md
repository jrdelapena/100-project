# 100-project/backend

This directory contains the code for the backend of 100-project.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.12.2

## Building

The backend is written using TypeScript, which requires transpilation to JavaScript before it can
be run directly. To do this, run `npm run build`. Alternatively, run
`npm run watch` to automatically transpile when files change.

## Running

To run the backend, run `npm start` after building the application.
